		<ABSTRACT>The significance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the respiratory tract of 9 cystic fibrosis patients have been studied by means of immunoelectrophoretical analysis of patients' sera for the number of precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the concentrations of 16 serum proteins.  In addition, the clinical and radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using 2 scoring systems.  Precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrated in all sera, the maximum number in one serum was 22. The concentrations of 12 of the serum proteins were significantly changed compared with matched control persons.  Notably IgG and IgA were elevated and the "acute phase proteins" were changed, the latter suggesting active tissue damage.  The concentrations of 3 of the acute phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, were correlated to the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins. The results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on the tissue of the respiratory tract. </ABSTRACT>
